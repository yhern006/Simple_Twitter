# Simple_Twitter

An implementation of a simple Twitter application.

It has two main parts: a client and server. Users use clients to share 
tweets and see the tweets of the other users they subscribe to.

The server is responsible for authenticating the users, getting their tweets 
from them, and sending those tweets to other users. Nothing is stored 
locally in the clients since all the information is received from the server.

This projects can be ran on an emulated virtual network in mininet.
